# react-caeser-cipher
This is an application I made using ReactJS to encrypt and decrypt text using the [Caeser Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

I deployed the application using Google Firebase.

Main things I learned from this project:

1. Writing cleaner code, especially in ReactJS
2. Using basic TailwindCSS
3. Creating an algorithm for the Caeser Cipher
